# Bytes Shift Encryptor
 Bytes Shift Encryptor

Encrypt malicious byte stream by swaping bytes randomly complete FUD result no heuristic/entropy detection ,No suspicious classes(AES Cryptography ..etc) used,only pure math.

6 you must however read the encrypted byte sequence from a separated file,out from web (on condition that you use non-suspicious functions to read it) because putting a PE bytes(even if encrypted) or large sequence of bytes in the same final exe you produce triggers Avs,using entropy Analysis Avs can infer the existence of another file in your exe,giving you thee signature Troj/Dropper gen
